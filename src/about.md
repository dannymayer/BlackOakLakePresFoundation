Anticipated activities include the following:

- Inspect and monitor the lake, its environs and nearby waterways for invasive aquatic plants such as Eurasian Water Milfoil, Zebra Mussels, Rusty Crayfish, Loosestrife, Curly Leaf Pond Weed, and other invasive animal and plant species.
- Train volunteers to check water quality and clarity at several different locations and at different depths of the lake to report any changes in water make-up and quality.
- Monitor each lake access as a preventative measure against introduction of harmful elements to the lake ecosystem and environs.
- Provide public education to increase awareness of the importance of:
    - Good water quality,
    - The protection of the lake and its environs from invasion by noxious aquatic plants and animals,
    - long-term planning to preserve the ecosystem and water quality for present and future users of the lake and environs.
- Encourage maximum safety for all who use the lake.

It is anticipated that volunteers interested in the Foundation’s purposes will undertake all activities. The primary source of support for the Foundation will be from the general public including lake property owners, area businesses and others who are interested in the Foundation’s charitable purposes.

Tax deductible donations, gifts or memorials may now be made to the new Foundation.
